#  Hi my name is Rawnsley. I am 27 years old. I play guitar and video games a lot. I am new to web developing and hopefully I can master it in a short period of time so that I can start earning large amount of money. The reason why I want to become a web developer so that I can earn more and have a new skill that does not require me to go out from home. Online jobs are now a big deal nowadays.
